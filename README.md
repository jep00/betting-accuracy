# Assessing the Accuracy of Betting Odds in European Football
My final year BSc project: <em>Assessing the Accuracy of Betting Odds in European Football</em>. All the files for the write-up are in the /code folder, with R being used for the coding. There is also the .tex and files created when compiled.<br>
The project included assessing bookmaker accuracy in a range of leagues, split into the <em>elite</em> group (high performing leagues) and the English &amp; Scottish pyramids (chosen due to data source) using various techniques. Once assessed, the findings were used to create a betting algorithm to attempt to 'make money'.
